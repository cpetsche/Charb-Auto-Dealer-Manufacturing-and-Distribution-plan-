# Charb-Auto-Dealer-Manufacturing-and-Distribution-plan-

Welcome to Charb-Auto, an international car manufacturer that has manufacturing plants and dealerships though out all of North America.  Charb-Auto has automobile manufacturing plants scattered over the US, CA, and MX.  They view their operations as “continental” and any vehicle manufactured in any country can be sold at any of their dealerships through out North America.  Of course they must consider transportation costs from the manufacturing plant to the dealership.  Additionally, due to the absence of trading agreements on automobiles between some countries, there are tariffs imposed that must be included in the distribution chain.  Not all cars are manufactured at all plants.  Help Charb-Auto develop a distribution plan for the upcoming year that minimizes total cost (manufacture, tariff, and transportation).

The following files are provided for use in the development of this model:
dealer_demand.csv: The annual demand for each car type (dealer name, car type, annual demand)
dealer_inforamtion.csv:  The information associated with each dealership (name, city, country, location, annual demand per vehicle type)
manufacture_data.csv:  The cost to manufacture each vehicle in each country (plant name, car type, hours to manufacture each car, cost to manufacture each car)
plant_data.csv: The information associated with each manufacturing plant (name, city, country, location, and total manufacturing capacity in hours)
road_transportation_costs.csv:  The information associated with transporting vehicles from manufacturer to dealership (origin country, destination country, cost/vehicle/mile) 
tariffs.csv: the country to country tariffs for each vehicle type (origin country, destination country, cost/vehicle)

Do the following for this project:
Load the raw data (inputs) into a database.  Do so using scripts to both create the database and to populate them 
Build a model by reading in the data from the database and formulating a feasible model that minimizes the cost for Charb-Auto
Write the solution to a table in the database as well as output the solution to the screen
